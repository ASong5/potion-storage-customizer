# Potion Storage Customizer Plugin
Gives you more control over the positions of your potions within the potion storage and bypasses the awful auto-sort when (un)-favouriting and adding new potions. Drag and drop to swap potions and your new layout will persist across sessions. Ideally makes the janky potion storage just a little less janky.
